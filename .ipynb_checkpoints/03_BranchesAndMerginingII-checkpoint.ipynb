    "- Merge Conflict Overview\n",
    "    - Merge conflicts occur when a person needs to make a decision\n",
    "    - We will see this if we have two different branches and then, we create new features in each of the new branches. \n",
    "    - When a Merge Commit is pushed, Git will return a merge conflict because two different branches change the same part of a file in two different ways\n",
    "    - Not a Merge Conflict\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_30.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "    - Automatically Merging Changes\n",
    "        - Git can automatically merge changes to different parts (hunks) of files. This can occur if two different changes occur and one each branch did changes to improve specific feautures. Git is smart enough to know it does not want to commit the part of the code in the branch that is not fixed.\n",

    "    - Avoid Merge Conflicts\n",

    "- Resolving a Merge Conflict\n",

    "        2. The tip of the branch to be merged (C) - \"theirs\"\n",
    "        3. A common ancestor (A) - \"merge base\"\n",

    "- Tracking Branch Overview\n",
    "    - A local branch that represents a remote branch (`<remove>/<branch>`)\n",
    "    - A remote branch that is clone to a the local machine will have everything that the remote branch contains (references and commits) with the addition of a reference to the remote master branch (the branch label that the remote referenced to before the clone)\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_35.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Notice that there could be three master branch label could point to three different commits: the local master branch, the remote master branch, and the master tracking branch\n",
    "        - This occurs because there is no way that the remote and local repo can communicate with one another (unless they are clone, push, fetch, or pull)\n",

    "    - `master`: Points to the latest local repo\n",
    "    - `remote/origin/HEAD`: It appears that the only use of this is to refer to `origin/master` and thus, can be reference without stating `origin/master` but just `origin`\n",
