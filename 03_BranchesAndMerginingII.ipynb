    "- Merge Conflict Overview\n",
    "    - Merge conflicts occur when a person needs to make a decision\n",
    "    - We will see this if we have two different branches and then, we create new features in each of the new branches. \n",
    "    - When a Merge Commit is pushed, Git will return a merge conflict because two different branches change the same part of a file in two different ways\n",

    "    - Automatically Merging Changes\n",
    "        - Git can automatically merge changes to different parts (hunks) of files. This can occur if two different changes occur and one each branch did changes to improve specific feautures. Git is smart enough to know it does not want to commit the part of the code in the branch that is not fixed.\n",

    "    - Avoid Merge Conflicts\n",

    "        2. The tip of the branch to be merged (C) - \"theirs\"\n",
    "        3. A common ancestor (A) - \"merge base\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- Tracking Branch Overview\n",
    "    - A local branch that represents a remote branch (`<remove>/<branch>`)\n",
    "    - A remote branch that is clone to a the local machine will have everything that the remote branch contains (references and commits) with the addition of a reference to the remote master branch (the branch label that the remote referenced to before the clone)\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_35.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Notice that there could be three master branch label could point to three different commits: the local master branch, the remote master branch, and the master tracking branch\n",
    "        - This occurs because there is no way that the remote and local repo can communicate with one another (unless they are clone, push, fetch, or pull)\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_36.png\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "- Viewing Tracking Branch Names\n",
    "    - `git branch --all`: Displays local and tracking branch names\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_37.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - In the image above, only the first and third line represent unique branches\n",
    "    - The second line references a symbolic link to an existing branch\n",
    "    - The second line actuall branch is the branch that is after the arrow (->)\n",
    "    - `remote/origin/master`: where origin is alias for the remote URL. It tracks the lates commit from the remote repo\n",
    "    - `master`: Points to the latest local repo\n",
    "    - `remote/origin/HEAD`: It appears that the only use of this is to refer to `origin/master` and thus, can be reference without stating `origin/master` but just `origin`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Changing `remotes/origin/HEAD`\n",
    "    - We can change the default remote tracking branch... `git remote set-head <remote> <branch>` where remote is \"origin\" and branch is \"develop\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Viewing Tracking Branch Status\n",
    "    - `git status` includes tracking branch status\n",
    "    - `git status` will inform you if the cached tracking branch information is out of synch with your local branch\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_38.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Notice how the command line states that the local repo is ahead of the remote repo by 1 commit\n",
    "    - Use `git log --all` to see a combine log of all local and tracking branches\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_39.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - In the screenshot above, we can see that the local repo (`HEAD -> master`) is ahead of the remote repo (`origin/master`) by one commit (or one feature)\n",
